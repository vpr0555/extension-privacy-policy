    <h1>Privacy Policy for "A Magnet Link Copier"</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how "A Magnet Link Copier" (the "Extension") handles your data.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The Extension does not collect any personal or identifiable information from its users. The Extension's functionality is to locate magnet links on the current page and copy them to the clipboard. All operations are performed locally on your device and no data is transmitted to an external server.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The Extension requires the following permissions to function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>activeTab</strong>: This is required to access the current tab only when the user explicitly clicks the extension icon. This is necessary to find magnet links on the page.</li>
        <li><strong>scripting</strong>: This is required to inject a script into the active page to find the magnet links and copy them to the clipboard.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used solely for the stated purpose of the Extension and do not grant access to any other user data or browsing history.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
